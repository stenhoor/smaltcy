# Installation

smaltcy is a graph database that runs in the page. You store nodes and relationships, each with labels or a type and
properties, and you query them with Cypher. Every example in these docs runs where it stands: press **Run** under one
to see its result, drawn as a graph when it has nodes or relationships ([sample data](./sample-data)).

## Install

```sh
npm install --save-exact @smaltworks/smaltcy@0.1.0
```

smaltcy 0.1.0 is not on npm yet. It has no runtime dependencies but smaltkit, the family's shared kit, which npm
fetches and builds from GitHub until it is published. The package has an entry point for each part, so a page loads
only what it uses: [Using the pieces](./modules) lists them.

## A first graph

```ts
import { open } from '@smaltworks/smaltcy';

const db = open(); // an in-memory graph

db.run(`
  CREATE (ada:Person {name: 'Ada', born: 1815}),
         (alan:Person {name: 'Alan', born: 1912}),
         (ada)-[:KNOWS {since: 1833}]->(alan)
`);

const rows = db.query('MATCH (a:Person)-[k:KNOWS]->(b) RETURN a.name AS a, b.name AS b, k.since AS since');
// [{ a: 'Ada', b: 'Alan', since: 1833 }]
```

- `db.run(cypher, params)` returns a result: `columns`, `rows`, the write `counts` and the time it took.
- `db.query(cypher, params)` returns the rows as objects.
- Nodes come back as `{ kind: 'node', id, labels, properties }`, relationships as
  `{ kind: 'relationship', id, type, start, end, properties }` and paths as `{ kind: 'path', nodes, relationships }`.

## Parameters

Pass values with `$name`, never by building strings:

```cypher noplay
MATCH (p:Person) WHERE p.born > $year RETURN p.name
```

```ts
db.query('MATCH (p:Person) WHERE p.born > $year RETURN p.name', { year: 1900 });
```

## Indexes

Lookups by label and property scan the label until there's an index:

```cypher
CREATE INDEX FOR (p:Person) ON (p.name)
```

Put `EXPLAIN` before a query to see the plan the engine chose. With the index, the first step is a `NodeIndexSeek`:

```cypher
EXPLAIN MATCH (p:Person {name: 'Ada'})-[:KNOWS]->(f) RETURN f.name
```

## Transactions

Each statement that writes is atomic: if it fails, nothing it did stays. To make several statements one unit:

```ts
db.transaction((tx) => {
  tx.run("CREATE (:Account {id: 1, balance: 100})");
  tx.run("CREATE (:Account {id: 2, balance: 0})");
});
```

## Next

- [Examples](./examples) shows common queries.
- [Sample data](./sample-data): the graphs the examples run on.
- The [Cypher reference](/reference/cypher) lists what smaltcy reads.
- The [playground](/playground) runs Cypher on sample graphs and draws the results.
